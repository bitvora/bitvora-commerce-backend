# Backend Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the backend service.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (version 1.16 or later).

## Setup

1. **Copy the Environment Variables File**

   Before starting the application, you need to create a `.env` file with your own configuration. Copy the example file provided:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials and desired application port.

2. **Start the Database with Docker Compose**

   Use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL database. Run the following command in the root of your project directory:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will start the database service in detached mode.

3. **Build the Go Application**

   After the database is up and running, build the Go application:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Finally, run the application:

   ```bash
   ./your_application_name
   ```

   Replace `your_application_name` with the name of the binary generated by the `go build` command.

5. **Access the Application**

   The application should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `2121`). You can access it via `http://localhost:2121`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with loading the `.env` file, ensure that the file is correctly named and located in the root of your project.
- Check the logs of the Docker containers for any errors by running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```
